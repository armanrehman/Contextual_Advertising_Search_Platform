# Contextual Advertising Platform

## Overview
This project is built using Python, Django, and several other technologies. The platform extracts relevant keywords from any given blog article URL and matches them with advertisements in the database. This allows the display of ads that are highly relevant to the content of the blog.

The project works by accepting a blog URL, parsing the content using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, extracting relevant keywords with `RakeNLTK`, and then displaying the most suitable advertisements based on those keywords.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for backend logic.
- **Django**: Web framework for building the app.
- **Requests**: Library used to make HTTP requests to blog pages and fetch content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parser used to extract and parse data from webpages.
- **RakeNLTK**: A tool for extracting the most relevant and prominent keywords from a text.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A CSS framework for styling the web app.
